This website was created by Marco Tedesco, a student in class 4th A AFM, as part of the Italian Ministry of Education and Merit project “From parliamentary classrooms to school desks,” to which the I.I.S.S. Carlo Maria Carafa institute in Mazzarino (CL) - Sicily was admitted following selections made from more than 3,000 schools to select about 60. The website deals with the various points established by Article 2 of the Italian Constitution, with a special focus on the concept of solidarity.
